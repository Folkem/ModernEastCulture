# ModernEastCulture
College practice project. Programming language - Java, with the usage of JavaFX library. 
The code was written on Java 8, so it will be working only on Java 8, 9 and 10, bc on 11th version JavaFX library was removed from the standard Java SE.
Task on the practice - make a database about modern east culture and corresponding GUI program to interact with the database. 
By "modern east culture" I've meant anime, manga, ranobe and anime movies.
